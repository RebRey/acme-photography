## Background
### What is the mobile first approach?
Mobile-first is when we start by writing our CSS for mobile devices and then use media queries to add in styling for larger screen sizes. 

### Why Code Mobile-first?
When we style for desktop-first, we're adding widths, columns, and moving things around. We're adding complexity. We're doing this for good reason, as we have more real-estate to work with. Code for larger screens is usually more complicated than the codes for smaller screens. This is why coding mobile first helps simplify your code.
